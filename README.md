### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

 My name is Odemakinde Elisha, a graduate of Electronic/Electrical Engineering at Obafemi Awolowo University. I am a machine learning engineer/researcher. My area of specialization is in computer vision. 
 - ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on Music Decoding (interpretation and translation) and the application of computer vision to real-time analytics.
 - ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the mathematical rudiments of vision.
 - ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects relating to vision and language modelling.
 - âš¡ Fun fact: I love maths.
