### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

 My name is Odemakinde Elisha. I am an AI engineer/researcher. My area of specialization is in edge intelligence.
 - Iâ€™m currently working as a AI Engineer focused on sport analytics.
 - I'm currently researching on AI with respect to music decoding (interpretation and translation), furthermore, building state of the art application of computer vision to real-time analytics using Reinforcement learning.
 - Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects relating to AI based sport analytics using vision, language processing and state of the art reinforcement learning architectures.
 - Aim: Build optimized architectures with low-latency, fast inferencing/compute and real-time analytics.
 - Fun fact: I love maths and I implement it.
