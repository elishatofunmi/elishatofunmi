### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

 My name is Odemakinde Elisha, a graduate of Electronic/Electrical Engineering at Obafemi Awolowo University. I am a machine learning engineer/researcher. My area of specialization is in computer vision. For instance, I have been able to apply my mathematical analysis to research areas like super-resolution and real-time object detection/localization. Furthermore, my research area expands into the field of Natural Language processing, with keen interest in language translation. 
 
 - ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on an interesting aspect of computer vision which is instance and semantic segmentation. Moreso, I am working on an area of NLP relating to musical decoding.
 - ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the mathematical breakdown of sementic segmentation.
 - ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects relating to object detection and segementation principles.
 - âš¡ Fun fact: I love innovations and I love exploring new ideas and technologies.
